# Problem 7 
You are given 2 containers: A and B. Container A can hold 5 litres of water, while
container B can hold 3 litres. You are also given a source of water that you can use as
you wish. Show how you can use the containers and the water source to put exactly 4
litres of water in container A. No coding required, just write down the steps.

# Solution

- Step1: Fill Container `B` with `3 Liters`.
- Step2: Move `3 Liters` From `B` To `A` Container which leaves us with `B => 0L, A => 3L`.
- Step3: Fill Container `B` with `3 Liters`.
- Step4: Move `2 Liters` From `B` To `A` Container which leaves us with `B => 1L, A => 5L`.
- Step5: Pour Container `A` which leaves us with `B => 1L, A => 0L`.
- Step6: Move `1 Liters` From `B` To `A` Container which leaves us with `B => 0L, A => 1L`.
- Step7: Fill Container `B` with `3 Liters`.
- Step8: Move `3 Liters` From  `B` To `A` Container which leaves us with `B => 0L, A => 4L`.
